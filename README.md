A set of bash scripts to make LaTeX document structures and files from the command line.


## latexmakefolder
The latexmakefolder script sets up a basic file structure for a LaTeX document. This structure consists of the main top-level directory, five subdirectories, and a main document file. The subdirectories hold additional latex files that are included in the main file. The directories and their purposes are:

1. appendix/
    For all content that belongs in the appendix.
2. circuit/
    For files that define circuit drawings in the main body of the document.
    See latexnewcircuit for more information.
3. img/
    For files that define non-circuit graphics in the main body of the document.
    See latexnewimg for more information.
4. table/
    For files that define table files in the main document of the table.
    See latexnewtable for more information.
5. tex/
    For additional .tex files that do not fit any of the above categories.

The options for latexmakefolder provide a way to entire information into the template structure from the command line. These options and their arguments are:

### -o, --output : Output filename
### -d, --directory : Output directory name.
