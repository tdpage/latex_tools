A set of bash scripts to make LaTeX document structures and files from the command line. These tools were developed from personal tools designed to save time and typing when writing long engineering reports, but have been generalized to support more documents than just project reports and homework submissions. The document structure is idiosyncratic to how I prefer it, and may not fulfill your needs.

Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/tdpage/latex_tools/wiki) for documentation on the tools.
